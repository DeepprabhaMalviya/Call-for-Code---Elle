## Short description

### What's the problem?

In rural and semi-rural communities, there is a lack of understanding of various diseases and health complications due to water contamination and improper sanitation. As a result, millions of children lose their lives each year across the planet, teenagers and adults get diseases that they carry for the rest of their lives, and environmental damage. Due to improper exclusion and timely quarantines, from a few people, entire communities may be affected. It may be from air & plasma borne diseases like COVID19, Influenza, Tuberculosis, and water-borne diseases like Arsenic Pollution, Typhoid, Dysentry and Hepatitis.

### How can technology help?

With modern technology, combining IoT, Advanced Algorithms, Machine Learning and Smart-Interaction methods with Artificial Intelligence, the diseases can be prevented by imposing smart sanitation systems to improve hygiene and community-symptoms monitoring systems. Smart Sanitation can also have an added advantage, methods to save and control unnecessary water wastage, thus improving the ecological balance.

### The idea

The idea is to set up smart-community hubs across multiple physical locations with an interactive system to govern the area. It will do the following :
1) Monitor the water sources with smart sensory data
2) Maintain water analysis reports and trigger a response if threshold is crossed
3) Keep an average population count of the blocks of communities assigned per community hub
4) Keep solo count of disease symptoms reported regularly at every block and raise alarm if threshold goes above a pre-determined level. 
5) The nearest health centre will be informed on an urgent basis and a containment team and doctors will be allocated. 

`Explanation --Say a person from Block A reported of Nausea, Vomiting and Severe Diarrhea on Jan 01. On the next couple of days, similar reports from that particular block/community started to get logged into the system. The system will immediately go into SOS mode, validate the sensory data, water quality at sources, and trigger a response to the controller for immediate remedial action. This will prevent pandemics even before things get really serious. This is a great way to ensure preventative measures to ensure and control sanitation quality across large communities. `

This is a general explanation of the idea. Implementation will be using sensory data, population datasets, realtime water source monitoring, machine learning for predictions and Artificial Intelligence for approximating the disease or problem that might be occuring in the blocks/communities it is responsible for monitoring.

## Demo video

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.


## Solution Roadmap

The project currently does the following things.

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

It's in a free tier IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster. In the future we plan to run on Red Hat OpenShift, for example.

See below for our proposed schedule on next steps after Call for Code 2021 submission.

## Getting started

We are readying the system for deployment. This section will be updated shortly.
